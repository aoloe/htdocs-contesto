      <meta name="generator" content="WPML ver:3.0.1 stt:4,1,3,27;0" />
      <link rel="alternate" hreflang="it-IT" href="http://contesto.illustration.ch/it/profilo/" />

content:

- create the other prices pages
- process the contact form (cf. old site)
- create the other pages.

style:

- add the address in the footer?
- really gray as a the text color?
- should the top bar be floating?
- should there be a way to go back to the splash screen?
- do we really want the (c) at the end and the flags with languages?
- in services there are two submenus... are they really needed? if yes how to manage / check the url and the menues?
- should the splash screen image be bigger? -> anchor the slider to the bottom of the page
