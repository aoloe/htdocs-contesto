# Our pool of translators

The impetus for the Contesto Translations project arose many years ago without the awareness of those concerned. Indeed, all the participants involved in the project met in the late 1990s at the Zurich University of Applied Sciences (formerly Dolmetscherschule Zürich).

From classmates to workmates: after completing our studies, we all took different career paths. Some of us started to work for various companies, thereby obtaining solid and outstanding professional experience, while others immediately gained a foothold as freelancers in the translation market, building an extensive network of contacts with clients and other translators.

The collaboration emerged spontaneously in response to the increasing demand for language services. The project therefore strengthened long-term collaboration, leaving the way clear for Contesto Translations to flourish as a standalone translation services provider capable of meeting even the most challenging requirements with which our clients present us.
