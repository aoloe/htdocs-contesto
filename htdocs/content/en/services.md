# Services

The core area of expertise of Contesto Translations is unquestionably the translation of written texts and localisation. It goes without saying that the translation process is not solely about rendering the message of a given text word for word, but also involves consideration of broader aspects such as context, be it national or international, culture and the activity of the company placing the translation order. So our capabilities stretch beyond mere translation. We strive to establish close contact with our clients so as to sustain successful, lasting relationships with them.

## Translation and localisation

We consider every single translation and localisation task as a fully-fledged project, each of which is performed by a group of language professionals capable of tackling the linguistic, technological, cultural and marketing aspects of the final product. Our translation services are provided by native language translators who not only possess translation expertise but who also excel in various key disciplines.

We translate from and to the Swiss national languages (German, French, Italian) as well as English and Spanish. We can also cover other language combinations. Request a free quote.

## Interpretation

_Simultaneous interpreting_ is the oral translation of a speaker’s statements carried out by a team of at least two interpreters per language combination. The interpreter listens to the incoming message in the source language through a headset and relays the message in the target language into a microphone. Each listener is supplied with headphones so that he/she can follow the speaker’s words in his/her own language. This mode of interpretation is most commonly used at large meetings, conferences or symposiums.

_Whispered interpreting_ (also known as chuchotage) is only intended for a small group of listeners and is typical of meetings and conferences. The interpreter sits next to or behind the listener and whispers the interpretation into his/her ear. This type of interpretation is usually performed by just one interpreter per language.

_Consecutive interpreting_ is a service performed by an interpreter who listens to the speaker and takes notes as the speech progresses without the aid of headphones. He/she then translates the speaker’s words at intervals of approximately 5 to 10 minutes. Consecutive interpreting is particularly suitable for short meetings or conferences in which only one language is to be interpreted.

_Liaison interpreting_ takes place in varied settings such as business meetings in which the interpreter mediates between two or more individuals who speak different languages. This service also includes interpreting during specialised conferences and linguistic assistance during trade fairs or other events.

We interpret from and to the Swiss national languages (German, French, Italian).
