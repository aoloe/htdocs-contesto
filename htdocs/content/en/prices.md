# Prices

The translation and interpretation fees charged by Contesto comply with the standards set out by the agency of the Interpreters' and Translators' Association, DÃœV. Depending on the type of document, translation orders are charged by the line (e.g. Word documents) or by the hour (e.g. Excel tables or PowerPoint presentations).

For every individual order, a more or less accurate quote will be submitted (with a 15% margin from the initially estimated cost).
